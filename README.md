# Brightness SlowMotion Fix
Stabilizes brightness variations (flicker) in slow-motion video caused by artificial lighting. The function operates on the assumption that the scene is mostly static, meaning the average brightness across all image regions should remain constant over time.

# Running

Prepare the environment
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/afsmaira/slowmotion_fix_bright.git
```

And run
```bash
fixbright --help
```
